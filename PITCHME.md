# JEE

A practical introduction to Java Enterprise Environment

---

## What is JEE?

JEE is :
- a bundle of specifications
- meant to be implemented by some vendors

JEE is not :
- a framework
- usable as it is
- necessarily completely used

---

## Why JEE ?

JEE helps to normalize the answers given to certain problems.
- The developer is "guided" through the solution
- The solution is standard, so should not depend on the implementation
- The solution is standard (bis), so every other developer can know what was attempted

## JEE : Range of applications

JEE applies to a wide range of software needs:
- Configuration management thanks to DI
- Persistence thanks to JPA
- Interoperability thanks to JAX-RS / JAX-WS
